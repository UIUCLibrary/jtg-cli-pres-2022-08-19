# Jon's Favorite Command-Line Tips and Tricks

I've forked this over to https://github.com/UIUCLibrary/bash-cli-tips-and-tricks. I'm planning on keeping that one up-to-date and let this one reflect the presentation I gave on 2022-18-19 since there were some links to that. 






This is an informal presentation for a Mind Meld session in Library IT. Goal is a 20 minute presentation (at most) talking about some of my favorite tips and tricks.

Given the nature of the presentation, I decided to experiment with the mdp, markdown presentation, tool.


So, to run the presentation in this directory, do 

`mdp pres.md`

Controls:

h, j, k, l, Arrow keys, Space, Enter, Backspace, Page Up, Page Down - next/previous slide
Home, g - go to first slide
End, G - go to last slide
1-9 - go to slide n
r - reload input file
q - exit


Slide title unicode characters are REVERSE CHECKER BOARD (0x1F67F)  and CHECKER BOARD (0x1F67E)

There's some shell scripts I'm using for examples, you might need to make them executable if you're 
following along:
`chmod u+x *sh`

Thanks to Alex Dryden for the "gg" instruction in less and Joe Troy for the suggestion to add how to delete from history to slides, as well as everyone who camea nd asked questions!
